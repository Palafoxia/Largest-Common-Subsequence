# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING - LARGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE

This is an implementation of the largest common subsequence problem, solved with dynamic programming.
The console application, `main.exe`, finds and displays the LCS for various example strings using both the recursive and dynamic programming solutions.

## Project structure
- `dynamic.cpp/h` in `src/` contains the dynamic programming solution
- `recursive.cpp/h` in `src/` contains the recursive solution
- `main.cpp` in `src/` contains the main application
